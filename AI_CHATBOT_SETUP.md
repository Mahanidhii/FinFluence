> **User**: "How much did I spend on food?"
> **Bot**: "This week you spent ₹1,250 on food..."

### **After (AI-powered):**
> **User**: "How much did I spend on food?"
> **AI**: "Looking at your food expenses, you've spent ₹1,250 this week - that's actually 15% higher than your usual pattern! I notice you've been ordering from Zomato quite frequently (₹450). Have you considered meal prepping? Based on your spending habits, I estimate you could save around ₹400-500 weekly while still enjoying great meals. Would you like me to suggest some budget-friendly meal planning strategies? 🍽️"
